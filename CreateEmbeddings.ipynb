      "Companies and healthcare providers are developing and implementing new applications of medical artificial intelligence, including the artifial intelligence sub-type ofmedicalmachine learning (MML). MML is based on the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to automatically identify patterns and act on medical data to guide clinical decisions. MML poses challenges and raises important questions, including (1) How will regulators evaluate MML-based medical devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness? and (2) What additional MML considerations should be taken into account in the international context? To address these questions, we analyze the current regulatory approaches to MML in the USA and Europe. We then examine international perspectives and broader implications, discussing considerations such as data privacy, exportation, explanation, training set bias, contextual bias, and trade secrecy.\n",

      "In the last few years, the application of Machine Learning approaches like Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have become more attractive in the healthcare system given the rising complexity of the healthcare data. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms provide efficient and effective data analysis models to uncover hidden patterns and other meaningful information from the considerable amount of health data that conventional analytics are not able to discover in a reasonable time. In particular, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been shown as promising methods in pattern recognition in the healthcare systems. Motivated by this consideration, the contribution of this paper is to investigate the deep learning approaches applied to healthcare systems by reviewing the cutting-edge network architectures, applications, and industrial trends. The goal is first to provide extensive insight into the application of deep learning models in healthcare solutions to bridge deep learning techniques and human healthcare interpretability. And then, to present the existing open challenges and future directions.\n",

      "When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.\n",

      "There is great excitement that medical artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning (ML) can be used to improve decision making at the patient level in a variety of healthcare settings. However, the quantification and communication of uncertainty for individual predictions is often neglected even though uncertainty estimates could lead to more principled decision-making and enable machine learning models to automatically or semi-automatically abstain on samples for which there is high uncertainty. In this article, we provide an overview of different approaches to uncertainty quantification and abstention for machine learning and highlight how these techniques could improve the safety and reliability of current ML systems being used in healthcare settings. Effective quantification and communication of uncertainty could help to engender trust with healthcare workers, while providing safeguards against known failure modes of current machine learning approaches. As machine learning becomes further integrated into healthcare environments, the ability to say I'm not sure or I don't know when uncertain is a necessary capability to enable safe clinical deployment.\n"
